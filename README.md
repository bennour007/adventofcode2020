# This is my first attempt to actually solve the puzzles in the adventofcode competition. 

If you can support them please do, they really deserve to. I can't, I'm poor.

Ah, yes, I use R btw, and I got very confused and I suffered to solve these puzzels, probably I am not used to such puzzels, but it's fun indeed.
